# python-challenge
PyBank
In this challenge I analyze all the data in the csv file to create a better understanding of the data. I present to you the total months, total amount made, average change between the profit and losses, the greatest increase and decrease in profits. 
The total amount of months calculated within this csv was 86 months.
The total amount earned within these 86 months were $22,564,198.
To find the average change, I needed to take the profit/loss from a month and subtract it with the month before. After that is done, i added up all up the results from the subtractions made between months and divided them with 85 months since there is no data on the month prior to the beginning of the dataset. This all came to the average change of $-8311.11
The greatest increase in profits what found by looking for the most profit made between the two months within the whole dataset.
The greatest decrease in profit was done in a similiar fashion but just looking for the lowest number or highest loss between two months in the whole dataset

Pypoll
In this challenge I analyzed the data given to me regards to the election data. With the data presented to me I was able to present to you total amount of voters, how many people as well as percentage of people who chose either Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, or Raymon Anthony Doane, as finally the winner of the election.
The total amount of voters came out to 369,711.
Charles Casper Stockham gathered a total of 85,213 votes or 23.049% of voters.
Diana DeGette gathered a total of 272,892 votes or 73.812% of voters.
Raymon Anthony Doane gathered a total of 11,606 votes or 3.139% of voters.
How I got these numbers were by using python and counting how many voters voted for them and dividing it by the total amount of voters. 
The ultimate winner of this election was Diana DeGette by a long shot.
